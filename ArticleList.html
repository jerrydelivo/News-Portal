              The price of crude oil has more than doubled over the past year
              after bottoming out at $26 per barrel in February 2016.

              The market is at all-time highs and many say Trump is the reason.
              But stocks were rallying when investors thought Hillary Clinton
              would win. Janet Yellen and the Fed may deserve more of the credit
              for the market's move.
